@par Example Description 

This Demo presents the implementation of a Virtual Com Port (VCP) capability in 
the STM32F207xx, STM32F407xx, STM32F429xx, STM32F446xx, STM32F469xx and STM32F107xx devices. 

The aim of this example is to read data from and write data to USB devices using the CDC protocol. 
It makes the USB device look like a serial port (NO serial cable connectors:You can see the data
transferred to and from via USB instead of USB-to-USART bridge connection). 
This example loops back the contents of a text file over usb port. To run the example, Type a message using the Pc's keyboard.
Any data that shows in HyperTerminal is received from the device. Here are the modifiction done versus the VCP example:

- In class layer usb_cdc_core.c : remove the asynchronous transfer which is called on SOF callback and remove management of class control 
  requests which are not needed for the simple send/receive.
- In application layer file usbd_cdc_vcp.c : implemente the above API functions:
		- VCP_SendData: Sends data 
		- VCP_CheckDataSent: Returns 1 when data sent
		- VCP_ReceiveData: Prepares reception of data 
		- VCP_CheckDataReceived: Returns received byte count
		
This example works
  - in high speed (HS) when the STM322xG-EVAL, the STM324xG-EVAL board, the STM324x9I-EVAL board, 
     STM32469I-EVAL or the STM32446-EVAL board and the USB OTG HS peripheral are used
  - in full speed (FS) when the STM322xG-EVAL, the STM324xG-EVAL board, the STM324x9I-EVAL board
    STM32469I-EVAL or the STM32446-EVAL board and the USB OTG FS peripheral are used, or when using
    the STM3210C-EVAL board.
    
@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example has been tested with STM3210C-EVAL RevB (STM32F107xx devices), 
     STM322xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F207xx), STM324xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F407xx), STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx),
	 STM32446E-EVAL RevB (STM32F446xx) and STM32469I-EVAL  RevC (STM32F469xx)
  
  - STM3210C-EVAL Setup 
    - Use CN2 connector to connect the board to a PC host   
  
  - STM322xG-EVAL Setup
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG HS peripheral
		@note Make sure that :
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM324xG-EVAL Setup
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG HS peripheral
		@note Make sure that :
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM32446E-EVAL Setup
    - Use CN9 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG HS peripheral
    
  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN14 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral
    - Use CN15  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral
      Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section "USB OTG2 HS & FS" in STM324x9I-EVAL Evaluation Board 
              User Manual.
        @note Make sure that :
         - Please ensure that jumper JP16 is not fitted when using USB OTG FS
        
  - STM32469I-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Connect the STM32469I-EVAL board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cable to the connector:
      - CN8 : connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral 
      - CN13: connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
      - CN14: connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral
        Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section "USB OTG2 HS & FS" in STM32469I-EVAL Evaluation Board

        @note Make sure that :
         - jumper JP9 must be removed when using USB OTG FS

@note Known Limitations
      This example retarget the C library printf() function to the EVAL board’s LCD
      screen (C library I/O redirected to LCD) to display some Library and user debug
      messages. TrueSTUDIO Lite version does not support I/O redirection, and instead
      have do-nothing stubs compiled into the C runtime library. 
      As consequence, when using this toolchain no debug messages will be displayed
      on the LCD (only some control messages in green will be displayed in bottom of
      the LCD). To use printf() with TrueSTUDIO Professional version, just include the
      TrueSTUDIO Minimal System calls file "syscalls.c" provided within the toolchain.
      It contains additional code to support printf() redirection.
